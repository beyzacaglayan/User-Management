This is a user management project. Users can register on this site, and a registered user can log in. 
Users who log in and register are directed to the profile page. 
On this page, the user's username, e-mail address and identity (user or admin) entered into the system are written. 
Admin users can list the information of all registered users.
Whether a user is an admin or a user is determined by the project owner. Users cannot choose to be an admin themselves.
MongoDB was used as the database. Node.js was used for the backend. React was used for the frontend.
